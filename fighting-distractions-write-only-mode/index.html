That is: I turn off notifications on email, messaging apps etc. However, there’s a big hole in my defenses: I often get distracted <em>reading</em> messages when I set out to <em>write</em> one.</p> <p>The typical thought process is: “I should send person X a message, before I forget.” To achieve this, I open some messaging app on my phone. However, the moment I open that app, I’m confronted with a few unread messages by other people. I follow the bright red icons, read the messages and respond to them.</p> <p>Having done so, I’m left wondering: “what was I doing again?” Person X is forgotten at this point.</p> <p>There are many similar situations which are essentially instances of the same problem:</p> <ul> <li>Wanting to search for a particular item in my email archive, and being confronted with incoming email.</li> <li>Opening a browser to look up something in particular, and being distracted by a homepage full of “interesting” news.</li> <li>Not even reaching the correct app: when opening the phone to interact with app A, being distracted by a notification in app B.</li> </ul> <p>The solution is obvious: the ability to configure my phone (and similarly: my email client) in “write only” mode. In that mode no indication at all is given that there are new messages, until the phone is set to normal mode again.</p> <p>In a slightly less drastic variation, a single exception would be made: opening a conversation with a particular person would show at least the messages sent by that person. This would avoid sending messages to a person without having read any (possibly relevant) messages of theirs, while still having the advantages of pure write-only-mode.</p> <p>As far as I know, neither of these options is not currently generally easy to configure on modern phones.</p> </section> </article> </div> <footer class="footer"> <span class="footer__copyright">&copy; 2019 .
