    <p>In the past few months I’m having some recurring thoughts and questions<sup id="fnref:alan-kay"><a href="#fn:alan-kay" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. What follows is mostly an attempt to force myself to structure these thougts and reach out to others that may share some insights on the subject. In other words: “warning: incoming rant.”</p>

<p>The subject of these questions is the current state of our software (I hesitate to say: Software Engineering, but I suppose it is implied). The general theme is: “why is the quality of our software so low?”. Some of the questions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why is software generally so slow?</li>
  <li>Why does software have so many bugs?</li>
  <li>Why can my computer be hacked? Why do virusses exist?</li>
  <li>Why do I need to restart my computer for this update? Why do updates exist at all?</li>
  <li>Why is software so complex?</li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming the premises are correct (software is generally slow, has many bugs etcetera), the consequences of not answering the questions are quite serious. A few examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unstable and buggy software makes its users feel powerless.</li>
  <li>Bad performance means more computers running, which means a greater contribution to the greenhouse effect.</li>
  <li>The lack of a workable security model has opened the way for mass surveillance.</li>
  <li>Our lives are increasingly dependent on software. This means the above consequences are increasingly severe.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some observations and hints towards the answers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The answers to the questions may very well be related.</li>
  <li>I have approximately 10 years of professional experience, yet I do not have the answers to the above questions ready.</li>
  <li>I am not alone. The <a href="/images/why-does-software-have-bugs-google.png">top</a> <a href="/images/why-does-software-have-bugs-result-1.png">Google</a> <a href="/images/why-does-software-have-bugs-result-2.png">results</a> <a href="/images/why-does-software-have-bugs-result-3.png">for</a> “why does software have bugs” are spammy sites. Not serious people seriously answering a serious problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>A few hints as to the answers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I do not have a full answer (yet?), but the title of this blog hints at some ideas.</li>
  <li>Software Engineering as a field is very forgetful of its past.</li>
  <li>We are a young field. There’s a lot of space for cowboys in the west, and in a gold rush it’s often more important who’s first than who’s right.</li>
  <li>A lack of ambition keeps us from asking the important questions.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope to expand on the above in more detail shortly.</p>
